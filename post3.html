Here is a concise article on whether remote workers are more productive:

Remote work has become increasingly common in recent years, with the number of people working from home tripling between 2019 and 2021[1]. While some employers are skeptical about the productivity of remote workers, research suggests that working from home can actually boost employee output in several ways:

- Remote employees report feeling happier and more productive at home, with 83% saying they operate at the same or higher productivity level compared to the office[2]. 
- Working from home eliminates time-consuming commutes and allows for more flexibility, which can lead to longer working hours and increased efficiency[1][2].
- Employees who work remotely are less likely to take time off and quit their jobs, which contributes to higher productivity[4].
- On average, workers who are satisfied with their jobs are 31% more productive, and remote work tends to increase job satisfaction[4].

However, remote work also presents some challenges that can negatively impact productivity if not managed properly:

- Lack of separation between home and work can lead to longer hours and burnout[2]
- Proximity bias may cause remote workers to miss out on opportunities and relationships[2]
- Distractions at home, such as family members, chores, and social media, can reduce focus[3]
- Difficulty disconnecting from work at the end of the day can increase stress[2]

To optimize productivity while working from home, experts recommend:

- Establishing a consistent routine and dedicated workspace[3][4]
- Setting clear boundaries with family and friends[4]
- Taking regular breaks to recharge[2][3]
- Using productivity tools and to-do lists to stay organized[3]
- Prioritizing communication with managers and colleagues[3]

Overall, the research suggests that remote work can boost productivity when implemented effectively, but it requires self-discipline, communication, and a supportive company culture[1][2][3][4][5]. The benefits of flexibility and job satisfaction often outweigh the challenges for both employees and employers.
