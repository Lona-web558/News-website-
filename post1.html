The abortion debate in the United States has evolved significantly over the past century. In the early 20th century, abortion was criminalized in every state, with limited exceptions for medical emergencies and cases of rape and incest[1]. However, despite the legal restrictions, nearly a million abortions were performed annually by the 1930s[1].

The women's liberation movement and sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s brought renewed attention to reproductive rights and access to safe abortion services[1]. In 1973, the landmark Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade affirmed the constitutional right to abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy[1][2]. This ruling nullified existing state laws that banned abortions and provided guidelines for abortion availability based on trimesters and fetal viability[1].

Over the following decades, the debate over abortion remained a prominent political issue, with activists and policymakers in many states seeking to change legal protections for reproductive rights[3]. In 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, ending the federal protections for abortion rights and returning the authority to determine abortion law to the states[2][3].

Since the Dobbs ruling, the debate has shifted to the state level, with some states passing laws restricting access to abortion and others moving to safeguard it[2]. The issue continues to be a source of intense political and social controversy, with the pro-choice and pro-life movements advocating for their respective positions on the moral, legal, and medical aspects of abortion[4].

Public opinion on abortion remains divided, with a majority of Americans disapproving of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade[2]. Women, Democrats, and religiously unaffiliated individuals are more likely to support abortion rights, while Republicans and White evangelical Protestants are more likely to oppose abortion[2][4].

As the debate continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how the legal and political landscape surrounding abortion will change in the coming years. However, one thing is clear: the abortion debate has been a contentious and ever-changing issue in American society for over a century[1][4].
